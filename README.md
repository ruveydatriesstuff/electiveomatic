# Elective-o-matic
Started during April 2020 as a toy project after taking my second programming course. 

Abandoned work-in-progress for a program that finds elective courses that the user is eligible for at Bogazici University. 

#### Intended functionalities: 

- Scrapes courses offered this term from university schedule and their departmental quotas. 
- Matches scraped courses to their prerequisites as given in department website. 
- Tracks timetable conflicts between required and eligible elective courses.
